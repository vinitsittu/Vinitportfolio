<p>This system utilizes computer vision techniques to monitor a driver's facial expressions in real-time. By analyzing the position of specific facial landmarks, it can detect signs of drowsiness such as excessive eye closure and yawning. If the system determines that the driver is exhibiting signs of fatigue, it triggers an alert to prompt them to take a break. This technology aims to enhance road safety by reducing the risk of accidents caused by driver drowsiness.</p>    <a href="https://github.com/vinitsittu/SpotifyClone">Visit Project</a>
